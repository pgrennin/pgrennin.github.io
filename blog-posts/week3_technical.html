    <h2>A Primer on JavaScript</h2>
    <h5>August 22, 2014</h5>

JavaScript is a programming language that makes the web interactive.  If you've ever gone to a website and played a game, saw an image slideshow, used a drop-down menu, or taken a quiz then you've seen JavaScript in action.  JavaScript should not be confused with Java, which is completely unrelated programming language.  <p>

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and one of the few that works in your browser.  The language was originally developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape.  His goal was to provide a language that would appeal to nonprofessional programmers.  The ECMA standard association adopted the language in 1997.  <p>

JavaScript works by manipulating elements in a webpage.  Elements are accessed through the Document Object Model (DOM), kind of similar to how CSS can access webpage DOM elements to style them.  JavaScript support is built right into all major web browsers.  Web browsers interpret JavaScript code to make your webpages interactive.  <p>

How is JavaScript different than HTML?  HTML is used to display static webpages, whereas JavaScript makes the webpage interactive.  <p>

JavaScript is a popular language because it is a relatively easy programming language to learn and it allows you to create fairly complex applications - think Google Maps. <p>

The language is criticized for a few reasons it is very easy to produce bugs that go undetected by the compiler. This can make it difficult to debug code and increase the development cycle.  <p>

JavaScript only runs in your browser window and because of this there are limitations to what it can do.  JavaScript cannot read from or write files in your computer.   It cannot access servers or databases.  Security in place prevents webpages from being able to access your computer, limiting the use of JavaScript relative to what other client-side software can do. <p>
