      <h1>Blog</h1>

      <div id="blog_text">
      In my inaugural lobg post for this site, I'm going to identify three of my favorite websites and explain why.  My three favorite websites are:
      <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/"> Quora</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon </a></li>

      </ul>
      <b> Google News </b>
      <br>
      The primary reason I like news.google.com is because it's very easy to navigate and allows you to customize content easily.  When I first go to the page, my eyes are drawn to the top of the page where the "Top Stories" are displayed.  Here I take a glance at some of the top stories and verify WWIII has not started.  I can also easily navigate to other categories of news using the left pane or just scrolling down.  As far as customization I can change which news categories are displayed and where they are displayed.  Additionally, I can alter which news sources to display, since not all news organizations just fit my worldview.  <p>
      I would describe this website as organized,  clean, simple, and tailored.  This site helps solve the problem of choosing which news story to read and getting news content that is tailored to you.  It saves time because instead of searching several different websites you automatically get the content you want to read in one place.  <p>
      It's easy to browse content in this site.  Every link or news story you click will open in a new tab.  I think this is much easier than having it load in the same window and then having to click the back button in your browser to get back to Google News.  <p>
      <b>Quora</b>
      <br>
      Quora is a great website because not only because the content is great but because it has great design. The content and features are very intuitive to use and it has a clean, uncluttered interface.  When I first log into Quora I'm drawn into the top stories in my newsfeed.  Quora displays these based on how popular they are and whether it is a topic I'm following.    The website allows users to get the best, most useful answera to any question they might have.  What Quora does is allow users to post questions and view the answers ranked by the number of upvotes, or likes, it received.  This simple concept results in readers getting great Q&A insights and not wasting time reading bad answers.<p>
      Another reason why I think Quora is great is the community.  Some of the smartest and most prominent leaders in Government and Business take time to contribute their knowledge in Quora.  In most cases the person who answers the question reveals their full name, which results in better more well-thought answers since their reputation is influenced by what they write.  It's sort of almost like a competition for who can give the best answers.   The website captures my attention and sometimes hours can go by while I just read questions and answers that capture my attention.  <p>
      <b>Amazon</b>
      <br>
      I also added Amazon on my list of favorite websites because of how useful it is to me, and how often I use it.  I will say that at times it can seem cluttered as a result of the site trying to display as many products as possible at one time.  When I first arrive at the website the first thing I usually do is I search for the product I'm looking for in the search box.  After the search I'm presented with products that are a combination of best selling and best reviewed.  It is very easy to find the best product available for what I'm looking for.  <p>
      Another great feature of the website is the review system, which is based on a 5 star rating scale.  Using the review score and reading some of the reviews, I believe I am making the best buy decision I can possibly make, even moreso than going to a store and talking with a salesperson, who don't always have my best interest in mind.<p>
      On Amazon there are a lot of cool features and options I can use.  Just a few of my favorite are: sorting reviews based on score or date; customizing color or other features of a product; getting shipping estimates for various shipping options.   Also, on a given page for a product Amazon displays related products or competing products, so you can easily navigate to another product and compare the differences between the products before making a decision to purchase.  <p>
      I use Amazon quite often and find it especially easy to make purchase for those miscellaneous items that I might not find at a grocery or clothing store.
