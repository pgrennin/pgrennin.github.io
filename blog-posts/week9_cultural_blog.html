<p>Writing good questions is probably a skill that is overlooked by developers.  Question-writing can be a crucial skill to help you overcome critical hurdles you will encounter as a developer.   Communities like Stack Overflow are a great resource to find answers to technical questions for both new and experienced developers alike.</p>

<p>Have you ever spent 5 hours or more trying to get a simple Ruby code to work but still can't figure it out? (I know I have).   Don't get mad, write a question. Practice writing great questions by using the following tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before asking the question try to find the answer before asking it.  This may seem like common sense, but usually you will find the answer to your question quicker if it already exists.  Try googling the question and look for related questions.
  <li>Golden Rule of question asking: imagine you are trying to answer the question.  This also seems like common sense but it can also help you write better questions.  For example, ask yourself if you were not familiar with the situation, could I answer this question?
  <li>Write a good question title.  The title should be a specific and concise question that summarizes your problem.
  <li>Include tags in the question.  This may differ depending on which site you use to ask the question but at Stack Overflow you should include tags that provide basic information such as the programming language or operating system you are using.
  <li>Make the first paragraph an executive summary of the question.  Include additional details in subsequent paragraphs.
  <li>Include sample code in your question.  Only include code that is relevant to the question and format it to improve readability.
  <li>Use good spelling, grammar, and formatting.  This also applies to writing in general.  It makes your writing more readable and shows respect toward readers.
  <li>Proof-read before posting.
</ul>

<p>After you post the question respond to feedback or answers you receive.  Be prompt in answering anybody's follow-up questions.  When you find an answer that solves your problem accept and rate the answer accordingly.  This rewards contributors and show respect to those who took the time to answer your question.</p>

<p>So far in Phase 0 I've had good luck finding answers that already existed to most questions I looked up.   As my workload becomes more challenging I'm sure I will find more opportunities to ask great questions in the future.  And now that I know these tips next time I encounter a roadblock I'll be sure to pose a question to the community.  Hopefully I can contribute some answers to the community as well.</p>
