    <h2>Challenges Facing the Tech Industry - Shortage of Developers</h2>

Among the biggest problems facing the tech industry is the lack of talented developers.  This is a problem which is of particular interest to me because I'll be in the market for a tech job beginning December 2014.   The strong demand for developers and high starting salary is one of the key reasons why I decided to resign from my job and attend Dev Bootcamp.<p>

The talent shortage in the tech industry seems have strong consensus.  IT executives across the board have commented that the lack of IT talent is a major challenge they face.  Code.org states that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computing jobs but only 400,000 Computer Science students.  This shortage of developers is also reflected in the unusually high median salary of $99,000 for software developers (source: bls.gov).<p>

What are the reasons for the shortage in tech talent?  The very high cost of a traditional university Computer Science degree and its 4 year commitment is a major barrier-to-entry for potential students.  I've also heard that universities are not preparing students with the necessary practical job skills to get hired as a developer.<p>

In recent years the tech industry has exploded in growth and has created jobs at a much faster rate than the market can supply.  Today, there are a growing number of computer operating systems, devices, screen sizes, and appliances that have become computerized.  The complexity brought on by these new devices has created a strong demand for developers.  Software is increasingly being offered online and many businesses are striving to create opportunities to meet these new trends - the previous company I was employed with was one of them.<p>

In my view, education will be a key component to solving this problem.  I think organizations like Dev Bootcamp, Codecademy .com, and Code.org are doing a great job making computer programming education more affordable and effective.  I think free online courses in computer programming are a great way to learn and promote interest in tech careers, but I'm just not sure it is enough to actually get a job.  In the long term I think the tech industry needs to figure out how to reduce complexity and make programming easier, maybe through developing easier programming languages.  This would make IT careers less intimidating.
