    <h2>My Thoughts on Pair Programming in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp</h2>
    <h5>September 7, 2014</h5>
<!-- text of article -->

<img class="blogImage3" src="../images/muppetspairprogramming.jpg" alt="pair programming"> <p>

Since I began Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp I've paired several times with students to complete challenges.  Peer pairing, and giving and receiving feedback are very much a part of the credo of Dev Bootcamp.  Through the process I've learned a lot  about myself.  <p>
Pairing has been a valuable tool for me to learn about myself.  I do admit that I don't like to rely on pairing for learning and that I've found pairing difficult.  I think I learn best by thinking to myself and going at my own pace.  I prefer quiet while trying to understand something rather than talking.  Sometimes pairing can be fun, but other time I felt flustered especially if the material is challenging or the partner is not a very good communicator.  At times there will be situations where I'm still trying to understand the instructions and my partner will be a few steps ahead of me, talking and interrupting my thought process.  This is not always the case though.  There have been some pairing sessions where I felt like I was ahead of my pair.<p>
A common theme in the feedback I've received from other students regarding pairing with me is that I need to speak up more, and express my thoughts.  My feedback was rated lowest in expressing my thoughts clearly.  This is because I'm introverted and I tend to think in order to talk, whereas extroverted personalities may be impatient with this style.  <p>
Writing feedback is pretty straightforward for me.  I try not to overthink and write what my first instincts are.  So far I have not had any pairing experiences that I would deem bad.  Most of the feedback I have given was favorable.  In some cases I felt my pair was great and I couldn't provide any critical feedback.   For me the most difficult thing with writing feedback to others is finding something critical and how to phrase it.  Naturally I dislike criticizing people and sometimes I felt my partner contributed more to the challenge and I was out of place to criticize them.  <p>
Overall, the feedback I received was helpful because it helped me realize a pattern that was going on.  Mainly that I do not speak up enough and express my thoughts clearly.  I will try to improve on this.  Also, I think it will be useful for me to prepare ahead of time for challenges.  This may mean reading the instructions and attempting the challenge before pairing.  By doing this I can prevent becoming flustered or feeling like I'm holding us back when we are actually pairing.  <p>
