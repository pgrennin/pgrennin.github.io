    <h2>My Learning Style</h2>
    <h5>August 25, 2014</h5>
<!-- text of article -->
In this post I'll explain my learning style and what we can learn from it.  According to the the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Mind Style Model</a> I am a <b>concrete sequential thinker</b>.  In this model there are two dichotomies - concrete vs abstract, and random vs sequential.  Concrete perceivers absorb information through the 5 senses, whereas abstract perceivers learn by visualizing and using intuition.  In the second dichotomoy, sequential thinkers organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner, whereas random thinkers organize information in chunks and in no particular order.    <p>

Concrete sequential learners, like myself, prefer logical sequence, clear  directions, and facts.  They also prefer structured and predictable environments.  Concrete sequential thinkers may find it difficult working in groups, working in an unorganized environment, and dealing with abstract ideas.  In my personal experience this is an accurate description.  Part of the reason I left my past job was because I felt the environment was disorganized and lacked structured. <p>

According to the <a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/index.asp">VARK learning model</a> I have a strong preference toward learning by reading and writing.  I prefer absorbing information wherever it is written, such as books and internet articles.  I found that the most useful resources in Phase 0 so far have been internet articles and reference websites such as W3Schools.com or Ruby Docs.  <p>

So far in Phase 0 I think I my learning styles have been effective overall and I am where I should be technically.  My biggest struggle so far in phase 0 has probably been pairing.  I don't despise it.  The problem is I prefer learning by reading or experimenting on my own.  In pairing situations I sometimes find myself flustered because I feel like there's time pressure and performance pressure.  I prefer going at my own pace.  At the same time I don't hate pairing and sometimes enjoy it because it can be a good way to break the monotony of working by yourself.  Pairing is also important in the corporate world and for learning so it's something I'll try to keep working at.  <p>
