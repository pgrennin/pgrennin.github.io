For this post I chose to write a bit about Rails (short for "Ruby on Rails") because I've heard many good things about it and it's something that I'll be learning at Dev Bootcamp.  I'm curious to know why the tech industry loves it so much, why Dev Bootcamp teaches it, and how it might be useful to me as an aspiring software developer. <p>

First, what is Ruby?  Ruby is a popular general-purpose programming language that is best known for web programming.  Ruby on Rails is essentially a software library that extends the Ruby programming language.  Rails is installed from the command-line using what are called called "RubyGems".  Using Rails developers can organize and create all the files necessary to run a complex website. <p>

<h3>What's so good about Rails?</h3>
There are a few guiding principals behind Rails that make Rails such an easy framework to work with for web development.
<ul>
  <li> Rails is opinionated which means there is a "Rails Way" of doing things.  As a developer this is a good thing because you'll have fewer decisions to make which results in faster development and easier maintenance.
  <li>Rails uses Convention Over Configuration.  This relates to the previous point about Ruby being opinionated.  There are conventional ways of doing things in Rails that make it easier for developers.  For example developers don't have to spend time setting up configuration files and choosing names to assign files.  This makes collaboration easier since other developers have learned the same conventions.
  <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).  Rails avoids duplication of code.  Duplication results in more complex programs that are difficult to maintain and debug.
</ul>
<h3>Why do programming bootcamps such as DBC, focus on Rails?</h3>
One of the co-founders of DBC, Jesse Farmer, wrote a great answer to this question on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Programming-Bootcamps/Why-are-so-many-Programming-Bootcamps-focused-on-Ruby-on-Rails">Quora</a>.  DBC teaches Rails over other web development frameworks because Rails is more welcoming to beginners.  He also downplayed the importance of focusing on a particular programming framework such as Rails because it is more important for beginners to learn the fundamental, unchanging aspects of programming since the technology is always changing.<p>

While I haven't spent much time with Rails yet, I'm looking forward to learning it.  It seems a lot less complicated than other web development frameworks, and I'll be able to create awesome full-featured websites. <p>
