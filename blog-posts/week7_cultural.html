    <h2>Exploring My Values</h2>
    <h5>Sunday, September 21, 2014</h5>
<!-- text of article -->
In this blog I've been tasked with exploring my values.    Here are some of the values that I think are important to me. <p>
<ul>
  <li> Accomplishment
  <li> Achievement
  <li> Efficiency
  <li> Health
  <li> Honesty
  <li> Personal development
  <li> Self-reliance
  <li> Wealth
  <li> Industriousness
  <li> Persistence
</ul>
One value that I think is especially important to me is efficiency.  I'm always looking for ways to improve how I spend my time and money.  I also spend a lot of time thinking of ways to complete tasks and goals more efficiently.  I think this is hard-wired into my personality ( I'm an ISTJ according to the Myers Brigg Type Indicator).   I enjoy reading books on productivity and self improvement.  I also dive into books on personal finance and investing.  It all ties with my desire for efficiency.  The downside of this is sometimes I can come across as uncaring and detached.<p>

In general, I try to live up to all these values as much as I can.   I feel like I have a natural attraction toward them as a result of my personality, life experience, and environment I grew up in.  One thing that this exercise has reminded me of is that everybody is different and has a different set of value as a result of their personality and life experience.<p>

One topic that I sometimes get asked for advice on is personal finance and investing.  I'm a very rational decision maker and I have experience successfully investing in stocks, funds, and real estate.  I think this ties in with my natural strengths such as efficiency.  I have an economics degree and have read several books on investing which allows me to hold my own in any conversation on the subject.<p>

There are several things I do to help when I feel down or stressed.  If I'm worrying about a problem I try to break down the worry by analyzing what's the worst that can happen, then I try to improve on the worse, a technique I learned from Dale Carnegie's book.  I also find meditation and prayer a great way to reduce my stress.
