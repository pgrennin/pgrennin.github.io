    <h2>Emotional Conflict</h2>
    <h5>September 28, 2014</h5>
<!-- text of article -->
  <h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>

  I tend to be an easy-going, friendly guy but I've had my share of conflict as I'm sure all well-adjusted adults have.  If you haven't you are probably overly nice and  too appeasing to everybody.   The last major conflict in my  life occurred in late June at my old job as Marketing Manager at Hydro Flow Products.  There were a few incidents leading up to the event which resulted in me resigning my job, but the main reason is that I was treated disrespectfully and poorly by boss.  There was a pattern of disrespect and treating me different than others at the company.    One example is that when we were at a tradeshow she organized a dinner outing but made sure I was the only one who was not invited.  Then the major incident I resigned over was when a project I was working on got micromanaged by her and she came down on me hard over insignificant details and wouldn't let me run the project how I wanted.

  <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
  The source of the conflict was that my boss was disrespectful to me and micromanaged me too much.

  <h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
  I handled the conflict by quitting my job.  On the compass of shame I think this would fall into withdrawal.  I felt that quitting my job was best for my career and my mental health so I do not regret the decision.  I had been considering finding another job for some time before that.

  <h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
  I think it made it better because it removed me from dealing with such a difficult person.  My boss' poor treatment of me was brought to light to the CEO who gave her a warning so she at least could learn from her mistakes.

  <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
  I'm not sure what I could have done to avoid such disrespectful treatment from my boss.  I probably would have tried to bring it to the attention of the CEO earlier so it could have been dealt with then, but Im not sure how big a difference that would have made.

  <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
  I learned that it is best to deal with problems early rather than withdrawing so they don't evolve into a  volcano eruption.
