    <h2>Stereotype Threat - What is it and why is it important?</h2>
    <h5>Sunday, September 14, 2014</h5>
<!-- text of article -->
For my Dev Bootcamp week 6 cultural blog post I've been tasked with researching and discussing the topic of Stereotype Threat.  Stereotype threat (ST) is a situation in which people's performance in some skill or task is reduced because of the fear of confirming negative stereotypes.  Studies have shown that ST reduces the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.  <p>

When a certain group is worried about confirming negative stereotypes, the resulting anxiety decreases their performance.  ST commonly occurs on standardized tests like the SAT where the resulting anxiety can have a large impact on test scores.  ST is a contributing factor of racial and gender gaps in academic performance, but it is important to note that it is not the only explanation for real-world performance gaps.  <p>

As a white male, I feel I haven't experienced ST as much as other groups, at least at a conscious level.   The only situations I can think of where I experienced ST was taking GMAT test and participating in sports when I was younger.  With regards to the GMAT I was aiming for a score in the 80th percentile or greater and I was perhaps too anxious during the test to perform well because most students with top scores had experience working in finance whereas my background was in marketing.  In some sports when I was younger, such as football and basketball, perhaps a factor that has prevented me from being a better athlete was the fact that I was somewhat smaller than most of the other players, and I let myself think that I couldn't compete with the larger players.  <p>

Jobs in the tech industry are overrepresented with white males, and underrepresented with racial minorities and women.  This is well documented in the media as a result of diversity studies published by the major tech companies Google, Apple, Yahoo, and others.  As a white male entering the tech industry, I feel an obligation to mitigate or at least not perpetuate ST in the industry.    How can I do this?   For starters by always treating every person I meet with respect no matter what their background, gender, or race.  Secondly,  I will give encouragement and mentorship to underrepresented groups who are considering entering the tech industry.  <p>
