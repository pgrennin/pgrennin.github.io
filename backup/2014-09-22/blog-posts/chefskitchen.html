<h2>My Thoughts on Dev Bootcamp at Week 1</h2>
I recently watched this <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">video</a> by Dev Bootcamp founder Shereef.  It really helped give me a glimpse into the culture of Dev Bootcamp.  Shereef explained the difference between the restaurant consumer mindest and the kitchen worker mindset.  The consumer is just paying for a product or service and does not take part in the process whereas the kitchen worker take ownership in the learning process and takes a creative mindset.  I feel like at times that I had the consumer mindset.  This is really how I viewed my college degree, but the analogy really helped me understand what makes Dev Bootcamp so different.  I really need to loose that consumer mindset and take control and ownership in my learning.  <p>

      The video also helped me understand how much hard work the program will be.  When he described that you'll basically have to say goodbye to any other commitments in your life he  helped me realize how much work this is going to be.  At the same time I'm excited to rise to the challenge.  Yes, it will be long hours that I'm not used to, but I think it's good to stretch my work ethic and learn how to get a lot of work done in a short period of time.  After all, that's a skill a great developer needs.<p>

      So far in my first week of prep, my biggest challenge has been getting the assignments done before the deadline.  I am going to just be able to finish all the week 1 assignment tonight (Sunday), but I feel like I spent too much time on some of the assignments and went to deep into them.  I didn't pace my self and I underestimated the amount of time it would take to complete all the other assignments.  And I don't have a good excuse either.   I am not working another job during the phase 0 prep.  Although I did put in at least 50+ hours of work this week, which is much longer than the 25 hour estimate that Dev Bootcamp gives on their blog.<p>

      The difficulty I've had meeting the week 1 deadlines and the amount of work and hours during the phases 1-3  has me somewhat nervous more than anything.  However, I believe if others can do it I can to.  I'm a disciplined person and have a strong work ethic.  I feel excited to take on this challenge in my life and believe I will succeed.  <p>
